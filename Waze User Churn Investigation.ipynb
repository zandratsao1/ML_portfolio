    "The XGBoost model made more use of many of the features than did the logistic regression model from the previous course, which weighted a single feature (`activity_days`) very heavily in its final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anything, this underscores the importance of feature engineering. Notice that engineered features accounted for six of the top 10 features (and three of the top five). Feature engineering is often one of the best and easiest ways to boost model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the important features in one model might not be the same as the important features in another model. That's why you shouldn't discount features as unimportant without thoroughly examining them and understanding their relationship with the dependent variable, if possible. These discrepancies between features selected by models are typically caused by complex feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? What insights can you report back to stakeholders?"
